Description: The 'India Lights' 'API' shows light output at night for 20 years, 
    from 1993 to 2013, for 600,000 villages across India. The 'Defense Meteorological 
    Satellite Program' ('DMSP'), run by the 'U.S.' 'Department of Defense', has 
    taken pictures of the Earth every night for 20 years. Researchers at the 
    'University of Michigan' used the 'DMSP' images to extract the data and provide 
    it in tabular form. The 'India Lights' 'API' provides the data at convenient 
    endpoints that allows you to look at specific time intervals and administration 
    levels. Tools are provided to query these 'API' endpoints.
