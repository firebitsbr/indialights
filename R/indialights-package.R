#' Tools to Work with the 'India Lights' 'API'
#'
#' The 'India Lights' 'API' shows light output at night for 20 years, from 1993
#' to 2013, for 600,000 villages across India. The 'Defense Meteorological
#' Satellite Program' ('DMSP'), run by the 'U.S.' 'Department of Defense', has
#' taken pictures of the Earth every night for 20 years. Researchers at the
#' 'University of Michigan' used the 'DMSP' images to extract the data and
#' provide it in tabular form. The 'India Lights' 'API' provides the data at
#' convenient endpoints that allows you to look at specific time intervals and
#' administration levels. Tools are provided to query these 'API' endpoints.
